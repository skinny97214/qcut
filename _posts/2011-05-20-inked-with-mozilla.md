Hooray! I just inked a contract with Mozilla to come on as a full-time UX Designer. I'll be working on external stuff like campaign sites and internal tools like crash reporter. I start June 13th.

The whole 35 person Web UX team is flying up to Portland the week after to meet me. Ok, not really. They're coming for <a href="http://opensourcebridge.org/">OSBridge</a>. Several Mozillans have talks:

<ul>
<li>Ryan Snyder: <a href="http://opensourcebridge.org/sessions/622">Pulling the Plug</a></li>
<li>Shyam Mani: <a href="http://opensourcebridge.org/sessions/577">DNSSEC @ Mozilla</a></li>
<li>Frederic Wenzel: <a href="http://opensourcebridge.org/sessions/576">Massively scaling Django for a global audience with Playdoh</a></li>
<li>Les Orchard: <a href="http://opensourcebridge.org/sessions/635">Inviting Contributors to Open Source Webdev through Virtualization</a></li>
</ul>

WAAAAHOOOOO!

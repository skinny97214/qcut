The dress shoppe down the way has a dirty little trick to make you come out of the fitting room... the mirrors are all on the outside. If the garment fits at all, you're forced to come out of your safe little room into the hall to see yourself. As soon as I stepped out of the room the sales lady breezes past and asks if she can bring me a pair of heels.

This trick does double duty. Firstly it gets ladies out of the fitting room if they're even possibly interested so the sales staff can compliment them. Second, it gives the staff an opportunity to upsell you or bring you a better size if what you have on isn't quite fitting.

Evil bastards! Brilliant, evil bastards. I think it works but I kind of hate them for it; maybe if only because I didn't think of it myself.

Even though I'd been using Firefox for a half a dozen years and have been working in tech for a decade, there was a lot I didn't know about Mozilla until recently. Judging from the questions I've been fielding since I accepted the position, you don't know either.

<strong>Mozilla is a non-profit.</strong> Unlike Google and Microsoft, Mozilla doesn't have a stock symbol. Mozilla Foundation wholly owns Mozilla Corporation which exists to employ me and the rest of the talented folks there to <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/about/mission.html">support the open web</a>.

<strong>How does Mozilla make money?</strong> Most of the revenues come from that little search box in the upper right-hand corner of Firefox. Search engines (Google, Bing) pay for placement. Those revenues are used to pursue the mission to push the web forward.

<strong>Mozilla is extremely friendly to remote workers.</strong> Of the ~400 employees, about 225 of them are remote. They have an excellent culture for keeping everyone connected like quarterly all-hands where everyone comes out to the HQ in Mountain View, CA. Please do check out the <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/about/careers.html">careers page.</a> Even if you don't see the exact fit for you, send in a resume. If we find an awesome person, we'll find a spot for them. For extra credit, send me a ping on <a href="http://twitter.com/skinny">twitter</a> so I can flag you in the hiring database.

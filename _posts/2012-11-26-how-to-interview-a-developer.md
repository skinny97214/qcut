I'm in the fortunate position of interviewing developers for the <a title="Code Talks and Designers Donâ€™t Speak the Language" href="http://identity.mozilla.com/" target="_blank">Identity team</a> at Mozilla. I'm not sure how common it is for a designer to interview a developer, but that's how we do. I <a title="twitter status" href="https://twitter.com/skinny/status/266233924286550016">queried Twitter</a> "Designers: When interviewing a developer for your team, what are your best questions for finding out if you'll work well together?" Here are the excellent responses.

===UPDATE 11/27===

I neglected to specify that of course, I'm not the *only* person interviewing developers. That would just be ludicrous. The majority of the people interviewing any given candidate will share the same skillset. Then a few others from the project team will ensure culture fit. Mozilla typically does two or three phone screens and approximately six in-person interviews.

The Willamette Week's <a href="http://wweek.com/editorial/3643/14449/">PieLab, More Than Meets the Pie</a> by <a href="http://twitter.com/rbbrown">Ruth Brown</a> *note they should be running a pie feature with a photo of my custardy-delicious Buttermilk Whiskey Pie this week.

Joe Smith of KGW came and filmed last Friday but haven't posted the video on their site yet.

We're located at NW 12th and Davis and are open Fridays from noon till the pies sell out, generally about 2:30 or 3:00.
